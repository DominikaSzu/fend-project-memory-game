## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Rules

In the game there is a deck of 16 cards, 8 pairs of the same symbol. The aim of the game is to find matching cards. If the cards do match, they remain turned over. If not, they will be flipped over. When the user finds all 16 matching cards, the game ends.

The time and moves are counted. At the end of the game, user sees the pop up window with the following information: 
* the amount of time
* number of moves
* number of â˜… received in star ranking
* possibility to play once again

Have fun! :relaxed:
